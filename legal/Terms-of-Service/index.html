    LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. NOTHING IN THIS
    AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE OR RESTRICT OR SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS EXCLUDING OR RESTRICTING THE LIABILITY OF POSTCENTIVE FOR (I) DEATH OR PERSONAL
    INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF POSTCENTIVE, ITS EMPLOYEES, OR ITS AGENTS; (II) WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF POSTCENTIVE; OR (III) ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT
    BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

    with, and consent to be bound by, the new terms. Except for changes made by Postcentive as described here, no other amendment or modification of this
    Agreement shall be effective unless set forth in a written agreement bearing a written signature by Postcentive and you.

<p>Each Provision of this Agreement is severable. If any Provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in any

    Provisions of this Agreement or of that Provision in any other jurisdiction.

<p>For purposes of service messages and notices about the Services, Postcentive may place a banner notice across its pages to alert you to

    <h3>9.5 Waivers.</h3> 
<p>No waiver of any Provision of this Agreement is binding unless it is in writing and signed by all parties to this Agreement, except that any
    Provision which does not give rights or benefits to particular parties may be waived in writing, signed only by those parties who have rights under, or
    hold the benefit of, the Provision being waived if those parties promptly send a copy of the executed waiver to all other parties. No failure to exercise,
    and no delay in exercising, any right or remedy under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of that right or remedy. No waiver of any breach of any
    Provision of this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of that Provision or of any similar Provision.

    has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.
</p>
    <h3>9.7 Force Majeure.</h3> 
<p>Except for payment obligations, neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure
